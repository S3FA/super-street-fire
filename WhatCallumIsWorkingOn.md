# In Progress #

Python:
  * ~~Learning python for the first time - watching some great google code tutorials (which can be found starting [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKTZoB2Vjuk))~~.
  * ~~Started up a directory for the server and front-end, I was working in eclipse using PyDev and checked in some of the eclipse data files along with some _really_ preliminary code~~
  * Figuring out data plotting and some basic GUI stuff using matplotlib

# Planned #

Design Work:
  * ~~Break the code down into modules ala UML class/domain diagram~~
  * ~~Start designing the game model representation~~
  * ~~Fire emitter state machine~~
  * Finishing up design for the flow of data through the game model

ioserver/gamemodel Code:
  * ~~Finish up writing the basic data structures for holding incoming data from sensor clients~~
  * ~~Start elucidating the code that will read data from a serial port and parse it into the above mentioned data structures~~
  * ~~Start programming the game model code~~
  * Finishing basic game model elements for Attack, Block, Fire Emitters, Players and the very basic game state (no rounds yet)
