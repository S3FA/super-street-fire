I will be working on putting together the simulator.


I'm thinking:
  * It will take moves as inputs. So the gesture processor would send "right medium punch" to the simulator and the simulator will trigger the fire effect for that move. 
  * Ideally we'll be able to use the same code to send to the actual fire-ring mechanism. 

Are there any guidelines/procedures in place already for interfacing with the fire-ring? What is envisaged interface to the fire ring looking like software-wise?
