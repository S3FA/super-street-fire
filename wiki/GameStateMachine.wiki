== Events ==
*Tick* : An event triggered every frame of the game simulation. When a tick occurs it updates the current state with the delta time that has occurred in the last frame and may result in a change of state based on the current state's internal values (e.g., timers, changes of condition, etc.)

*Calibrate* : A very particular event that changes the current state to be in the 'Calibration' state, this event only has an effect in vary particular states.

*StartGame* : An event used to trigger the beginning of a game - this is mainly used as an event that allows the game state to depart from being Idle and move into the various 'round' states.

*TogglePauseGame* : Pauses or un-pauses the game based on the current state. The game can only be paused if it's currently in play, otherwise pause will be ignored (except in the special case where the game is already paused, in which case the game will be restored to its previous state before the pause).

*StopGame* : Causes the game to stop, immediately. Consider this event a type of 'kill' event - it will instantly cease all game play and terminate the current game state, bringing it back to being Idle.

*UpdateWithHeadsetData* : Updates the current state with headset data - this never causes the state to change.

*UpdateWithGloveData* : Updates the current state with glove data - this never causes the state to change.

== States ==

*Idle* : A state where the entire game is reset so that nothing is happening - all fire emitters should be turned off and no game or calibration is occurring.

*Calibration* : A special state where players orient/position themselves in a particular way so that data can be collected from glove/headset sensors in order to give a 'zero' state that the game can use as a reference point when actual game play is taking place. This state lasts for a set amount of time.
