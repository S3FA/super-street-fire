#summary The requirements and specifications for the software-side of the Super Street Fire project.

= Requirements =

  * There are two sequential sets of flame effects hardware:
    ** Each set has eight flame effects (for a total of 16 flame effects)
    ** The number of flame effects on each set will always be consistent but that number is flexible and should therefore be adjustable.
    ** Each flame effect also has two associated colour sprays (each corresponding to a player)
    ** Flames and colour sprays need to be turned on/off by software

  * There are two players at any given time:
    ** Each player is wearing two gloves (one on each hand), which capture inertial measurements (velocity, gravitational forces, orientation)
    ** Each player is wearing a headset that records brain activity via Electroencephalography
    ** The gloves and headset for each player will wirelessly transmit data
