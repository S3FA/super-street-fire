#summary High-level overview of the GestureRecognizer software package.

= Purpose and Description =

The GestureRecognizer contains all of the code responsible for analyzing incoming data from a player's (or ring master's) gloves (i.e., gyroscopic, accelerometer and magnetometer data from each of the glove's inertial measurement units) and then recognizing and outputting gestures that are relevant to the Super Street Fire game. The GestureRecognizer package will likely contain a machine learning data structure that will have been trained to recognize player and ring master gestures. In the case of the players, recognizable gestures will include all types of attacks (e.g., jab, hook, hadouken) and the blocking gesture. For the ring master, the GestureRecognizer will need to recognize certain "spectacle" gestures (e.g., raising of hands, twirling of hand in the air).
