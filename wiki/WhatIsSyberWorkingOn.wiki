#summary IO and gesture recognizer

== Introduction ==

After a bit of fiddling with the IMU output, the three basic states are defined (jab, hook, block). We're looking to expand to hadouken, dragon punch, and a couple more. In discussion.

=== Gestures ===

There are some test programs in the "GloveTests" project that work with a single device over direct serial, plus some "testdata". 

The data is four streams of x-y-z or roll-pitch-yaw: 
  * Headings (orientation relative to the calibration orientation)
  * Acceleration (useful for punches, and power of move)
  * Gyros (useful for twisting/turn based movement)
  * Magnetometer (not used)

For any real testing, (as of May 1st) the game is processing wireless input and throwing it into the gesture state machine.

*TODO:* make sure those moves are turned into the right state!

=== IO ===

All the data goes through the sender/receiver modules. Pretty simple stuff.

*TODO:* output the fire state bytes.
