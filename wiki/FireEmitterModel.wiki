#summary High-level overview of the FireEmitterModel software package.

= Purpose and Description =

The FireEmitterModel package contains the software representation of the hardware flame effects ("fire emitters") that make up the player feedback mechanism in the Super Street Fire arena. The representation for each of the fire emitters will hold information concerning its

  * current colour (or mix of colours), which represent the player(s) that the flame belongs to
  * percentage of flame intensity currently active on the emitter
  * Identifier/position in the arena, this will also identify whether its a rail emitter (i.e., its one of the emitters on the interior of the arena, between the two players) or a ring emitter (i.e., its in the arena's outer ring of fire emitters)  

When values change for a particular emitter or set of emitters, events will be raised by the FireEmitterModel to indicate that the corresponding hardware in the arena should change.
