Super Street Fighter Simulator
==============================

Simulator Objective:

  Untimately the purpose of this code is to simulate the real ring of fire 
  controlled by fighting gloves for the very physical game of Super Street Fire.
  
  The simulator was built with the idea that it may be used a lot by non-developers; 
  it is designed to look like a game itself. Albeit, a very simple game. There will 
  be 2 players with 16 flame spouts around them and their moves will come entirely 
  from keyboard commands or commands from another library. 
  
  Thus, this is a very simple 2d sprite-based game where different fighting
  animations play based on input from other software modules.
